# zsa-keymapp-python

Control your ZSA keyboard (Moonlander / Voyager / Ergodox) using the [Keymapp](https://blog.zsa.io/keymapp/) API (Protobuf) in Python.

See also a Talon implementation https://github.com/ohare93/zsa-keymapp-talon for voice and foot-pedal control of your keyboard layers.

## Installation

This repo uses poetry as a package manager and Python 3.12 (though older versions may work fine).

1. Install the dependencies in the pyproject.toml

```sh
poetry install
```

2. Generate the Protobuf API code from the keymapp.proto file

```sh
poetry run python -m grpc.tools.protoc -I. --proto_path . --python_out . --mypy_out . --grpc_python_out . ./protos/*.proto
```

Any .proto files in the protos/ folder will be used for generation.

## Usage

Ensure your Keymapp API is enabled in the application,

![](./assets/keymapp-settings.png)

Run it:

```sh
poetry run python keymapp.py
```

This will change the keyboard layer to the 2nd layer (layer 1!). Change the code in keymapp.py to do whatever you like ðŸŽ‰ Set the layer, increase the brightness, change led colours in your keyboard. See protos/keymapp.proto for the valid endpoints.
